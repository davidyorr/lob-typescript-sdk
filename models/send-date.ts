/**
 * A timestamp in ISO 8601 format which specifies a date after the current time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off for production. Setting a send date overrides the default [cancellation window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed, that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted to UTC.
